# cmd: Command Entrypoints

[中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

`cmd` hosts the command-line and daemon entrypoints for Ora Cloud. Packages in this directory are
strictly limited to runtime configuration loading, dependency injection, process lifecycle wiring,
operating-system signal handling, and process exit codes.

## Module map

- [server](server/README.en.md) is the primary authoritative HTTP API service daemon.
- [gateway](gateway/README.en.md) is the browser-facing authentication and reverse-proxy boundary: GitHub OAuth login, PostgreSQL sessions, and internal credential issuance.
- [cloudctl](cloudctl/README.en.md) is the restricted deployment and operations CLI for migrations, tenant bootstrap, and credential reference management.
- [devsetup](devsetup/README.en.md) is the development-only one-shot setup (`task setup`): from `config.toml` it generates the Gateway private keys, the public keys Cloud trusts and the PKCE key, writes the GitHub client secret file and `.local/dev.env`, and applies migrations.
- [simulator](simulator/README.en.md) provides an all-in-one local demo environment backed by in-process Substrate and Git execution doubles.
- [ora-skill-materialize](ora-skill-materialize/README.en.md) is the assigned Node's sandbox-local, one-shot Skill materialization helper (reuses the canonical Go codec/materializer, invoked over a closed stdin/stdout channel, never starts the Agent process).
- [openapi](openapi/README.en.md) compiles and synchronizes the canonical OpenAPI 3.0 specification (`api/openapi.json`) from Go contract definitions.
- [checkformat](checkformat/README.en.md) enforces repository Go formatting standards as a strict failing CI gate.

## Boundaries and invariants

- **No domain logic**: `cmd/*` packages contain zero domain policy, state transition algorithms, or transactional logic. All domain behavior belongs to `internal/core`.
- **No direct database queries**: Commands acquire database pools exclusively via `internal/repository` and hand them directly to `internal/core.NewStore`. No raw SQL, GORM models, or queries exist in `cmd/*`.
- **Resource cleanup on exit**: Process termination must flush logging buffers (`logger.Sync`), close database connection pools (`store.Pool.Close()`), and cleanly cancel background contexts.
- **Fail-fast on startup**: Commands immediately abort with non-zero exit codes if configuration loading, schema checksum verification, database ping, or cryptographic trust verification fails.
