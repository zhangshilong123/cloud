# Ora Cloud

[中文](README.md) | [English](README.en.md)

Phase-one implementation of the Go/Gin cloud core, authoritative PostgreSQL persistence, internal authentication and bounded control contracts, plus simulated execution components that use real HTTP, PostgreSQL, disk, and Git boundaries. This repository does not yet include the Rust Controller/Workspace Node split, the Desktop refactor, or Kubernetes deployment.

Requires Go 1.27.1, Git, PostgreSQL 17, and optionally Task. The database is initialized through GORM and injected into the application, while the transaction layer executes parameterized PostgreSQL SQL. There is no global database handle, SQLite/MySQL sample user CRUD, or production-startup AutoMigrate.

## Local validation

On Windows, PostgreSQL 17.11 can be installed and started in isolation under the project's `.local/` directory without creating a system service:

```powershell
./scripts/postgres.ps1 start
$env:TEST_DATABASE_URL='host=127.0.0.1 port=55432 user=postgres dbname=ora_test sslmode=disable'
task check
```

The script listens only on `127.0.0.1:55432` and uses local-test trust authentication. The binaries come from the [EDB PostgreSQL Windows distribution](https://www.enterprisedb.com/download-postgresql-binaries), with a pinned version and SHA256 checksum. Stop it with `./scripts/postgres.ps1 stop`; the data is retained.

Docker is also supported:

```sh
docker compose up -d --wait
export TEST_DATABASE_URL='host=127.0.0.1 port=55432 user=ora password=ora-local dbname=ora sslmode=disable'
task check
task test:race
```

Each test creates an isolated PostgreSQL schema and cleans it up automatically. The test account requires CREATE SCHEMA permission. `task check/test/test:integration/test:race` sets `REQUIRE_POSTGRES=1`; without a real PostgreSQL configuration, these tasks fail instead of silently skipping tests. A direct `go test ./...` explicitly skips integration tests when PostgreSQL is not configured. Use `task test:unit` to run non-PostgreSQL tests separately.

Race testing on Windows requires a working C compiler:

```powershell
$env:CC='D:\tmp\ora-cloud-test-tools\llvm-mingw-20260908-ucrt-x86_64\bin\x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc.exe'
$env:PATH=(Split-Path $env:CC)+';'+$env:PATH
task test:race
```

This is the isolated tool path used during the original validation. Other machines should configure their own MinGW/LLVM-MinGW `CC`. Linux CI uses the system C compiler.

## Running

The default configuration file is `configs/config.yaml`. Every existing setting can be overridden with a `CLOUD_` environment variable, such as `CLOUD_DATABASE_DSN`. Production databases should use TLS, a dedicated DML identity, and a separate deployment migration identity; do not use the sample local trust configuration.

```powershell
# The default sample targets the local ora_test database above; specify -config for real deployments.
go run ./cmd/cloudctl -command migrate
go run ./cmd/cloudctl -command bootstrap -name 'Engineering Organization' -source 'huawei-corp' -subject 'stable-account-id' -display-name 'Initial Administrator'
go run ./cmd/cloudctl -command credential-ref -tenant '<tenant UUID>' -owner '<user UUID>' -secret-ref 'infra-secret://git/team/account'
```

`bootstrap` atomically creates a tenant and its first administrator and is a deployment operation; running it again creates another tenant (when `-source` is `huawei-corp`, `-subject` must be the stable `uuid` returned by IDaaS rather than the employee number). `credential-ref` stores only an infrastructure reference and never accepts a Git credential value; tenant and owner foreign keys scope the reference. A regular member must first access `/api/v1/me` through an authenticated gateway to create the user, and an administrator must then add that user explicitly through the membership API. There is no self-service organization registration or automatic authorization from external groups.

Before starting production, configure internal verification public keys as described in [Authentication and credentials](docs/authentication.md). Startup fails when the trust configuration is empty:

```sh
go run ./cmd/server -config /path/to/config.yaml
```

The server only checks applied migrations and their checksums; it does not execute DDL. Database, migration, trust, or listen failures cause a non-zero exit. `GET /healthz` checks PostgreSQL reachability.

Run the complete creation demo directly; it generates short-lived simulated signing keys independently and uses them only for in-process testing:

```sh
go run ./cmd/cloudctl -command migrate
go run ./cmd/simulator
```

The demo starts isolated loopback HTTP cloud and Substrate services, creates a test tenant, bare repository, main linked worktree, simulated sandbox, and Node, and then outputs the ready Workspace. Disk state remains under `.local/demo/`, and PostgreSQL records are retained; each subsequent run creates another demo tenant. The simulator has no production infrastructure credentials, does not deploy Kubernetes, and does not start real Agent or Deno runtimes.

## Frontend

The official web frontend lives in [`frontend/`](frontend/README.md): React 19 + TypeScript + Vite +
Tailwind CSS 4 + TanStack Query, with the API layer compiled by [orval](https://orval.dev) from
[`api/openapi.json`](api/openapi.json). It installs, develops, and builds independently:

```sh
cd frontend
npm ci                 # Node >= 24, see frontend/.node-version
npm run dev            # Vite dev server (:5173); /api, /internal, /healthz proxied to :8080
npm run build          # tsc -b && vite build
```

Auth reuses Cloud's dual-JWT: the browser holds only a session cookie + user profile; `cmd/ora-web`
signs tokens server-side (the browser is untrusted). Dev requires a real PostgreSQL — start the
database per "Local validation" above and `task run` (:8080), then `npm run dev`.

Demo vs formal: `cmd/demo-issue-board-web` is a single-file HTML Kanban demo (no frontend
dependency, no CORS, server-side JWT signing) for manual API verification; `frontend/` is the
formal product UI. The two coexist and are not interchangeable.

## Contracts and boundaries

- [OpenAPI 3.0](api/openapi.json): all 19 public endpoints, 15 internal endpoints, and health. `task openapi` regenerates it, while tests validate the document, generated output, and actual HTTP response structures.
- [Web frontend](frontend/README.en.md): `frontend/src/api` is generated by orval from the same `api/openapi.json` into typed TanStack Query hooks; `task frontend:generate` runs Go contract → JSON → TypeScript in one step, and CI fails on generated-client drift.
- [Core invariants and state machines](docs/core-contract.md): identity, ownership, idempotency, admission, leases, recovery, and cleanup.
- [Substrate/Node and phase-two boundaries](docs/execution-contract.md): shared-volume layout, maintenance Jobs, container mounts, Git semantics, and migration ownership.
- [Requirements—implementation—validation checklist](docs/acceptance.md): current evidence and incomplete phase-two validation.

## Module architecture and layered documentation

Every subsystem, service command, and tool follows the same rigorous architectural design as Ora Desktop and has its own module-level specification:

  - [Integration test suite (`integration/`)](integration/README.en.md): end-to-end integration tests using isolated, real PostgreSQL schemas.

Phase one serializes core transactions with a database-level global advisory lock and permits only one unfinished operation per Project. HTTP, Git, and Substrate calls never hold a database transaction. This choice suits the initial single-cluster, active-singleton deployment and trades write throughput for simpler concurrency invariants. Locks may later be partitioned by tenant or Project, but the existing concurrency tests must continue to pass.

The container packages server, gateway, and cloudctl and runs as a non-root user. Build it with `docker build -f scripts/Dockerfile -t ora-cloud:phase-one .`, mount your own configuration and public keys, run migrations separately from the same image with `--entrypoint /app/cloudctl`, and run the authentication Gateway with `--entrypoint /app/gateway` (see `docs/gateway.md`). Repository CI is split into two workflows: `Backend` runs formatting, static checks and race-enabled integration tests against a PostgreSQL service; `Frontend` runs only when `frontend/`, `api/` or `internal/contract/` change, verifies the generated client matches the contract and runs the format, lint, type, coverage, module docs/tests, dead-code, duplication and build gates (see `frontend/AGENTS.md`). Docker images and real deployment are outside the locally validated scope.
